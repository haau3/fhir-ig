### Introduction

According to [AARP's 2025 Caregiving Report](https://www.aarp.org/pri/topics/ltss/family-caregiving/caregiving-in-the-us-2025/), roughly one in four Americans (63 million) is a family caregiver in America. A dramatic increase of 45% since 2015. These family caregivers, thereafter just caregivers for short, are family, friends, and children that come from all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds. These caregivers assist with activities of daily living (ADL) like bathing, dressing, and feeding, but also instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) like managing finances and coordinating transportation. 59 million reportedly are caring for adults aged 18 or older and 4 million are caring for children under age 18 with an illness or disability.

For caregivers, balancing their caregiving duties with work is a challenge. Seven in ten are are gainfully employed, but half report experiencing some work disruption that include arriving late, leaving early, or taking time off to care for their loved ones. Working caregivers also report experiencing more isolation (25%), taking on more debt (22%), using up short-term savings (31%), or late to paying their bills or leaving them unpaid (19%).

The AARP report reveals a growing population of caregivers that are strained, under-supported, and often invisible. However, it also provides a comprehensive look into the state of caregiving in the US to enable our nation to form better economic, financial, and health policies to support our nation's caregivers and the individuals they care for.

### Purpose
[Haau3](https://haau3.com/) is a FHIR-native, AI-powered companion to help caregivers focus on the human side of care by automating as much of the administrative burden as possible. 

### Scope
The haau3 FHIR Implementation Guide (HFIG) is designed to solve the interoperability problems that generate many of the administrative burdens that caregivers face. The scope will focus on caregiver and patient-mediated use cases with a priority on the following key areas:
- Centralization of all healthcare data into a single, user-friendly app
- Use AI to automate administrative tasks and guide caregivers towards effective resources
- Bidirectional sharing of data between patients & caregivers and healthcare entities

### Dependencies
To take advantage of the latest technology innovations, HFIG will be anchored on the following FHIR Artifacts
- [US Core 6.1.0](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/index.html)
